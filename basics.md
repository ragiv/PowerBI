<b>M Query Language basics</b>

What is Query Folding in Power BI

<p>Run the profiler and check what is happening when you filter on Power Query editor?
Any transformation logic which you have written/applied in power query, pushes that logic back to source Query language, for example sql server (if we connected to the SQL Server).</p>
 <i>Thsi push backs does not happend when we select Advance query editor while connecting to the server.</i>
